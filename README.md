## Description

This project was an assignment at Hack Reactor to develop the front end of an e-commerce web app using an existing api and backend (which was recreated in a future assignment). Some of the challenges with this assignment were adapting new code to work well with an existing api, integration of components from different developers, and learning how to implement new technologies while meeting deadlines.
